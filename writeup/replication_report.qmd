## Introduction

Human interpersonal communication is increasingly mediated by videoconferencing technology. Platforms like Zoom allow users to see themselves but not hear themselves. @walter-terrillSuperficialAuditoryDisfluency2025 found that participants rated a job candidate more favorably when the audio quality of their application statement was clear vs. distorted but otherwise comprehensible. This finding provides empirical support for the influential communication theory media ecology, which suggests characteristics of the medium through which a message is delivered may affect people independently of the content of the message itself. Practically, microphone quality represents a relatively simple target for intervention that could increase a family's socioeconomic status if it is indeed critical in hiring decisions. The increasingly popularity of podcasts as news sources could also affect how listeners judge the quality of information presented, regardless of the content. @bailensonNonverbalOverloadTheoretical2021

The target of this replication is Experiment 4, in which 1200 participants from the Prolific platform were randomly assigned to the clear or distorted audio conditions (600 in each group). After listening to the audio statement, participants rated how likely they would be to hire the candidate on a continuous scale from 0 to 100. I will additionally conduct several exploratory analyses with the goal of generating hypotheses to test in future work.

2)  Apparatus and data cleaning: The authors used custom webpages built from jsPsych libraries and a custom matching algorithm to assess the accuracy of the transcriptions. If they are not able or willing to provide these materials, they would need be recreated. Imperfect transcripts were manually checked by two coders, adding time, effort, and complexity to the procedure.

3)  COI disclosure: In the interest of transparency, I disclose that I occasionally work as an independent contractor for the National Academies of Sciences, the publisher of PNAS, where the original paper was published. Last year I was assigned to write a brief summary of this paper for the journal. However, I had no role in selecting this paper to cover nor relationships to the authors. My work for NAS/PNAS has no bearing on the journal's editorial decisions as research summaries are assigned only after acceptance.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

#### Original Study

Table 1 displays the results of a post-hoc power analysis for the original study's Experiment 4 as well as Experiments 1 and 5 (briefly explain what these are).

```{r power analysis_original}
# calculate original study's power
pwr_original = tibble(experiment = c(
  "Exp. 1: Hireability",
  "Exp. 4: Hireability",
  "Exp. 5: Intelligence"),
  voice_type = c("Human", "Computer", "Computer"),
  n_per_group = c(300, 600, 600),
  total_n = c(600, 1200, 1200),
  effect_size = c(0.35, 0.43, 0.20)) %>%
  mutate(power = map2_dbl(
    n_per_group,
    effect_size,
    ~{pwr.t.test(n = .x,
                 d = .y,
                 sig.level = 0.05,
                 type = "two.sample",
                 alternative = "two.sided")$power}))

pwr_original %>%
  kable(caption =
          "Table 1. Original Study Power Analysis (post hoc)",
        digits = 2,
        col.names = c("Experiment", "Voice", "n per Group",
                      "Total N", "Effect Size (d)", "Power"))
```

#### Replication

Because the original study found the same effect across voice types, my power analysis pools across voice type to determine the total N needed to achieve 80-95% power (Table 2).

Here I will discuss the power calculation for my replication.

```{r power analysis_replication}
# calculate total sample size needed for 3 power levels
# Main effect of audio quality (pooled across voice types)
pooled_analysis <- tibble(analysis = "Audio quality main effect (pooled)",
                          effect_size = 0.43) # from Exp. 4

pooled_power = pooled_analysis %>%
  mutate(
    n_80 = map_dbl(effect_size, ~ceiling(
      pwr.t.test(d = .x,
               power = 0.80,
               sig.level = 0.05,
               type = "two.sample")$n)),
    n_90 = map_dbl(effect_size, ~ceiling(
      pwr.t.test(d = .x,
                 power = 0.90,
                 sig.level = 0.05, 
                 type = "two.sample")$n)),
    n_95 = map_dbl(effect_size, ~ceiling(
      pwr.t.test(d = .x,
                 power = 0.95,
                 sig.level = 0.05, 
                 type = "two.sample")$n)),
    `80%` = n_80 * 2,
    `90%` = n_90 * 2,
    `95%` = n_95 * 2)

pooled_power %>%
  select(analysis, effect_size, `80%`, `90%`, `95%`) %>%
  kable(caption = "Table 2. Replication Power Analysis (a priori)",
        col.names = c("Analysis", "Effect Size (d)", "80% Power", "90% Power", "95% Power"))
  
# final power analysis
pwr = pwr.t.test(n = 125,
                 d = 0.43,
                 sig.level = 0.05,
                 power = NULL,
                 type = "two.sample",
                 alternative = "two.sided")$power
```

### Planned Sample

> Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

Based on the above power analysis, I will recruit 250 participants from Prolific to yield `{r} round(pwr*100, digits = 1)`% power to detect the main effect of audio quality. The study will remain active on the Prolific platform until 250 submissions are received. Because this study involves random assignment to one of four conditions (see below), this sampling strategy may result in slight differences in n per group.

### Materials

This replication will use four of the eight audio stimuli from the original study, which are available in the repo and were also published with the PNAS paper.

#### Human voice

The human voice recording will be identical to the original. It was prepared by the original authors as follows:

> "The Clear audio stimulus (in mp3 format) was a recorded narration by a naive male speaker. The recording (Audio S1) was 27.5 s and consisted of the following spoken text: 'After 8 y in sales, I am currently seeking a new challenge which will utilize my meticulous attention to detail, and friendly, professional manner. I am an excellent fit for your company and will be an asset to your team as a senior sales manager. As an experienced sales manager with my previous company, my tenacious and proactive approach resulted in numerous important contract wins. Through this experience, I have improved and developed my networking skills, which have proven to be very effective in increasing my number of sales.'” [@walter-terrillSuperficialAuditoryDisfluency2025]

#### Computer voice

The artificial voice recording will be identical to the original. It was created by the original authors using Amazon Polly (https://aws.amazon.com/polly/):

> "The audio stimulus (Audios S7 and S8) was generated (as in Experiment 3) using a simulated male American English voice (“Matthew”). The recording was 28.5 s long and consisted of the same text as used in Experiment 1." [@walter-terrillSuperficialAuditoryDisfluency2025]

#### Audio quality manipulation

The distorted audio stimuli will be identical to the original. They were prepared by the original authors as follows:

> "The Distorted audio stimulus (Audio S2) was created by modifying the Clear recording using the open-source VST effect “MDACombo” (42) in the TwistedWave Online Audio Editor (https://twistedwave.com/online), with the following settings: Model: 4x12\>; Drive: –55; Bias: 83; Output: 0; Process HPF Frequency: 20%; HPF Resolution: 90%. This resulted in speech that was fully comprehensible, but that had a high-frequency tinny quality like that commonly experienced during videoconferences with a low-quality computer microphone." [@walter-terrillSuperficialAuditoryDisfluency2025]

### Procedure

The experimental procedure will be identical to the original except as noted in unquoted text below:

> "All experiments were completed on custom webpages created with software written in a combination of PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, with the jsPsych libraries (40). Before beginning each experiment, listeners were asked to either wear headphones or move to a quiet environment. To discourage multitasking, listeners completed the experiment with their browser in full-screen mode. During debriefing, listeners reported whether they heard the stimuli using speakers or headphones." [@walter-terrillSuperficialAuditoryDisfluency2025]

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section. The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.

**Clarify key analysis of interest here** You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

-   Confirm no sig diff in comprehensibility

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study. The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur. Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

-   Instruction audio was clear in all conditions
-   Did not include transcription task (Exp 1), rely on self report of comprehensibility
-   Because the original study found that same effect across computer and human voices, I pooled across voice types to achieve greater power with the preregistered sample size

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample

Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan

Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt. None of these need to be long.
